Did you know we assigned one of our *best* pain technicians -- pain technicians, they used to be called torturers, ever since they got organized it's 'pain technicians' -- Why are you here? One of our very best torturers, I felt certain he would break him. Two hours he worked, not a sound. I said: 'Give me a cry, rin-tintsy(?). Give me a shout, a whimper, a scream.' Silence! So, I got to it myself. You can't leave these things to others, they never get it right! And well, you can see for yourself. If I didn't know better, I would say he was a mute. Silence! I'm beginning to understand what you're going through with this G'Kar. How you put up with this at all, I have no idea. He was a small burden.",
