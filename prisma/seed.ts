So, I got to it myself. You can't leave these things to others, they never get it right! And well, you can see for yourself. If I didn't know better, I would say he was a mute. Silence! I'm beginning to understand what you're going through with this G'Kar. How you put up with this at all, I have no idea. He was a small burden.",
